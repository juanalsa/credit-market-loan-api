API [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) for Mercado Cr√©dito loans.

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 17](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Maven 3.8.6](https://maven.apache.org)

## Running the application locally

This application is packaged as a war which has Tomcat embedded. No server is necessary. You run it using the ```java -jar``` command.

* Clone this repository
* There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.business.creditmarketloanapi.CreditMarketLoanApiApplication` class from your IDE.
* You can build the project and run the tests by running
```shell
mvn clean package -DskipTests=true
```
* Once successfully built, you can run the service by one of these two methods:
```shell
java -jar target/credit-market-loan-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
* Or you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:
```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
* Check the stdout to make sure no exceptions are thrown

Once the application runs you should see something like this

```

### To view your H2 in-memory database

To view and query the database you can browse to http://localhost:8080/h2-console. Default username is 'h2' with the same password. Make sure you disable this in your production profiles. For more, see https://goo.gl/U8m62X
